description: Introduction to Backstage with Kratix
sidebar_label: Introduction
---

Backstage is a framework for building developer portals, while Kratix is a
framework for building Platforms. Both systems can integrate with each other to
provide an end-to-end experience for developers.

With Kratix, you can automate the process of populating the Backstage catalog
with Components and Templates. Developers can then send requests to Kratix via
the Backstage Template to create and manage Resources.

This document will give you an overview of the architecture and go through the
steps to integrate the two systems.

```mdx-code-block
import BackstageDiagram from "/img/docs/ske/backstage-diagram.png"
```

## Architecture

To integrate Kratix with Backstage, you need to configure five things:

1. Make Backstage send requests to a Git repository
2. Configure your Platform cluster to reconcile on changes to the repository
2. Update your Promise to generate Backstage Entities in the Workflows
3. Configure Kratix to send the Backstage Entities to a State Store
4. Configure Backstage to read its catalog from a State Store

The diagram below shows the architecture of the integration. The numbers in the
diagram correspond to the steps above.

The following sections will go through each of these steps in detail.

* In [Configuring Backstage](./configuring-backstage), you will learn how to configure
  the communication from Kratix to Backstage (4 and 5 in the diagram).
* In [Configuring the Plugins](./plugins), you will learn how to set up the communication
  from Backstage to Kratix (1 and 2 in the diagram).
* In [SKE Backstage Generator](./generator), you will learn how to automate catalog population
  in Backstage (3 in the diagram).
