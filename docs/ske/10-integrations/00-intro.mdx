On this section, you will find information about the different integrations and
Aspects available for SKE.

Aspects are a set of pre-built pipeline images that you can integrate with
your existing Promises. These images are designed to support key use-cases of
Kratix Promises, and integrate seamlessly with different tools.

The documentation is divided in the following subsections:

- In [Backstage](./backstage/intro), you will find documentation on how to
  configure your Backstage instance with the [SKE plugin](./backstage/plugins), as well as how to
  configure your Promises to auto populate the Backstage catalog using the [SKE
  Backstage Generator](./backstage/generator).
- In [Terraform Enterprise](./tfe), you will find information about the SKE TF State Finder
  Aspect, which integrates Kratix Promises with
  [Hashicorp Cloud Platform](https://www.hashicorp.com/cloud) (both Terraform Cloud and
  Terraform Enterprise).
