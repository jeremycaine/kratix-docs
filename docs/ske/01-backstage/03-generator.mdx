The SKE Backstage Generator provides automated generation of the necessary Template and
Component manifests for your Promises and requested Resources.

These manifests are read by Backstage and are designed to work seamlessly with the
SKE Backstage plugins.

## Prerequisites

### SKE Backstage plugins

The `ske-backstage-generator` uses an action from the `ske-backend` Backstage plugin.
This action is used within the generated Template to create a Resource Request.
The generated Components are also used by the `ske-frontend` Backstage plugin to display
Promise and Resource metadata.

In order to utilise the Templates and Components, you should also install both the
`ske-backend` and `ske-frontend` plugins into your Backstage instance.

See [Configuring the Plugins](./plugins) for instructions.

### Backstage Destination {#destination}

You must have a Destination created with the `environment: backstage` label. See the
[Kratix Backstage docs](./configuring-backstage#configure-a-destination-for-backstage)
for setup instructions.

## How does it work?

The `ske-backstage-generator` image is intended to be run as part of your Configure
Pipeline for your Promise and Resource Workflows. It will auto-generate Backstage Template
and Component manifests, and schedule them to your [Backstage Destination](#destination).

### Promise Configure

In a Promise Configure workflow, two Backstage manifests will be generated:

- **Promise Component:** A Backstage Component representing the Promise.
- **Promise Template:** A Backstage Template representing the Promise API (i.e. the CRD
  for Resources created fromt this Promise).

Check the [YAML File Format](./yaml-file-format) for examples of these manifests.

### Resource Configure

In a Resource Configure workflow, a single Backstage manifest will be generated:

- **Resource Component:** A Backstage Component representing the Resource.

Check the [YAML File Format](./yaml-file-format) for examples of these manifests.

## Accessing the SKE Generator image

The image is hosted in a private registry. To access the image, you will need to
authenticate using the token you have been provided with. For docker, you can
run the following command, providing your token as the password when prompted:

```bash
docker login ghcr.io --username syntasso-pkg
```

If you are using a different container engine, follow the docs for your specific
tool.

Once you have authenticated, you should be able to pull the image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.1.0
```

Your Kubernetes cluster must have permission to [pull this image from the
private
registry](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#configuring-nodes-to-authenticate-to-a-private-registry).

If you are following the [quick-start guide](./quick-start), you can load the image
directly to the Kubernetes cache. Different tools have different commands for this. For example:

```bash
# For minikube
minikube image load ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.1.0

# For KinD
kind load docker-image ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.1.0
```

For other tools, follow their specific documentation.

:::info

If your cluster is running in a secure environment, you may wish to pull this image and
push it to an internal registry which your cluster has permission to pull from.

## Using the image in your Workflows

To use the `ske-backstage-generator` image, update your Promise definition to include the
generator as a workflow step for both the Promise Configure and Resource Configure
workflows:

```yaml title="workflows section in a Promise file"
  ...
  workflows:
    promise:
      configure:
      - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Pipeline
        metadata:
          name: promise-configure
          namespace: default
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/jenkins-configure-pipeline:v0.1.0
            name: jenkins-promise-pipeline
          #highlight-start
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.1.0
            name: ske-backstage-generator
          #highlight-end
    resource:
      configure:
      - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Pipeline
        metadata:
          name: instance-configure
          namespace: default
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/jenkins-configure-pipeline:v0.1.0
            name: jenkins-configure-pipeline
          #highlight-start
          - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-backstage-generator:v0.1.0
            name: ske-backstage-generator
          #highlight-end
```

Once your Promise is updated, the generator will be run as part of your
Workflows. If you install the Promise, you should see a Component automatically
appearing in your Backstage instance, together with a new Template. If you use
the Template to create a Resource, you should see the resource Component
appearing as well as the Resource itself being created in your cluster.
