A common use-case for Kratix Promises is to schedule workloads to run on
Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise. This page provides information on how
to:

1. Configure HCP as a Kratix Destination.
1. Write a Promise that can schedule workloads to HCP.
1. Use the SKE Aspect to pull information out of HCP.

This documentation assumes the existance of a HCP Workspace that's configured to
apply Terraform configurations from a Git repository. Please refer to the [HCP
documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/creating)
for more information on how to create and configure the Workspace.

## Configuring the Destination

Once you have a a Workspace configured to listen to a Git repository, you can
configure Kratix to be able to send workloads to it. To do this, you will first
need to create a GitStateStore pointing to the same Git repository you're using
for your HCP Workspace.

Create the GitStateStore, replacing the placeholders with your own values:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: GitStateStore
metadata:
  name: workspace-repo
spec:
  authMethod: <AUTH METHOD>
  branch: <BRANCH>
  secretRef:
    name: <SECRET NAME>
    namespace: <NAMESPACE>
  url: <MY WORKSPACE REPOSITORY>
```

Refer to the [GitStateStore documentation](/main/reference/statestore/gitstatestore)
for more information on how to configure the GitStateStore.

Next, create a Secret with the credentials needed to access your HCP Workspace:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: hcp-credentials
  namespace: default
stringData:
  organization: <HCP ORG NAME>
  token: <HCP TOKEN>
  workspace: <HCP WORKSPACE NAME>
```

To generate a token, refer to the [HCP
documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens.html).

You can now create a Destination, tying everything together:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Destination
metadata:
  name: hcp
  annotations:
    kratix.io/tf-credentials: '{"namespace": "default", "name": "hcp-credentials"}'
  labels:
    environment: terraform
spec:
  filepath:
    mode: none
  stateStoreRef:
    kind: GitStateStore
    name: workspace-repo
```

<details>
<summary>Destination in Details</summary>

There are a few important things to note about the Destination above.

* The `spec.stateStoreRef` is pointing to the GitStateStore you created earlier.
* The `spec.filepath.mode` is set to `none`. That's because HCP does not support
  nested directories, which is how Kratix writes to the State Store by default.
  It also means your Promise needs to output unique files as part of the
  Pipeline, otherwise multiple requests will overwrite the same file.
* The `metadata.annotations.kratix.io/tf-credentials` is a JSON object that
  contains the reference to the Secret you created earlier. This is used by the
  SKE Aspect to pull information out of HCP.
* The `metadata.labels.environment` is set to `terraform`. This is not required.
  You will use that label later when writing your Promise.

</details>

With all the resources created, you can now write a Promise that schedules workloads to HCP.

## Writing a Promise

HCP does not support nested directories in the State Store, so your promise
needs to ensure the uniqueness of the files it writes.

Here's an example Promise that schedules a workload to HCP:

                args:
                  - -c
                  - |
                    cat <<EOF > /kratix/output/main.tf
                    output "promise-configure" {
                      value = "some-value"
                    }
                    EOF
    resource:
      configure:
        - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Pipeline
          metadata:

            namespace: default
          spec:

                command: [ "sh" ]
                args:
                  - -c
                  - |
                    name=$(yq '.metadata.name' /kratix/input/object.yaml)
                    name=$(yq '.metadata.namespace' /kratix/input/object.yaml)
                    cat <<EOF > /kratix/output/${name}-${namespace}.tf
                    output "${name}-${namespace}" {
                      value = "some-value"
                    }
                    EOF
```
</details>


Let's break down the Promise above. It starts with the `destinationSelectors`:

```yaml
spec:
  destinationSelectors:
    - matchLabels:
        environment: terraform
```

This Promise will only run on Destinations that have the label `environment:
terraform`. This is the label we set on the Destination earlier. The value of
the label is not important, as long as it's the same on the Destination and the
Promise. Please refer to [Managing Multiple
Destinations](/main/reference/multidestination-management) for more information.

Next, check the `spec.promise.configure` workflow. You will find the following
in the pipeline:

```bash
cat <<EOF > /kratix/output/main.tf
output "promise-configure" {
  value = "some-value"
}
EOF
```

Since the Promise workflow will run only once per Destination, the outputs it
generates need only be unique within a single Destination. Your terraform code will
likely to be more complex, but this is a simple example to get you started.

Finally, check the `spec.resource.configure` workflow. You will find the
following:

```bash
name=$(yq '.metadata.name' /kratix/input/object.yaml)
name=$(yq '.metadata.namespace' /kratix/input/object.yaml)
cat <<EOF > /kratix/output/${name}-${namespace}.tf
output "${name}-${namespace}" {
  value = "some-value"
}
EOF
```

Since the Promise workflow will run once per resource, the outputs it generates
need to be unique. The example above uses the resource's name and namespace to
generate a unique filename and output name. You may need to adapt your code to follow the
same pattern.

## Adding the SKE Terraform Aspect

If you followed the steps above, you should now have a Promise that schedules
workloads to HCP. However, given that the Terraform code will be planned and
executed by HCP, the users of your Platform won't have access to the Terraform
outputs directly.

To solve this, you can use the SKE Terraform Aspect. This Aspect will pull the
Terraform outputs from HCP and make them available in the Resource's status.

To use the Aspect, you need to add it to your Promise as a second Pipeline in
the `spec.resource.configure` workflow:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Promise
# ...
spec:
  workflows:
    resource:
      configure:
        - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Pipeline
          # ... workflow that generates the Terraform code

        - apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Pipeline
          metadata:
            name: output-writer
            namespace: default
          spec:
            containers:
              - image: ghcr.io/syntasso/ske-tfstate-finder:v0.1.0
                name: fetch-output
                env:
                - name: TIMEOUT
                  value: "30m"
```

The `TIMEOUT` environment variable should be configured to match the amount of
time you expect the Terraform plan and apply to take. The Aspect will keep
trying to fetch the outputs until the timeout is reached.


:::info

The `ske-tfstate-finder` image is hosted in a private registry. To access the
image, you will need to use the access token provided by Syntasso and your
Kubernetes cluster must have the permissions to pull images from the registry.

You can also set `imagePullSecrets` in the [Pipeline
spec](/main/reference/workflows#pipelines).

:::

By default, the Aspect will add the Terraform outputs in the Resource's
`status.outputs`. If you want to customise what gets persisted, you can set the
`SKIP_STATUS` environment variable in the Aspect's container to `true`. When the
flag is set, the Aspect will create a set of `*-output.json` files in
`/kratix/metadata` with the Terraform outputs. You can then use that to make
your own updates to the status in `/kratix/metadata/status.yaml`.

In the example Promise above, the Promise Configure `status.yaml` would look like this:

```yaml
...other status keys
outputs:
  hcp: # Destination name
    promise-configure: "some-value" # HCP output name/value
```
