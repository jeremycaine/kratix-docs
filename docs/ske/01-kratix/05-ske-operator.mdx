## What's the SKE Operator?

The SKE operator follows the [Kubernetes operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) and provides full lifecycle support for Syntasso Kratix Enterprise.

The operator has its own [releases](../releases/ske-operator) and it manages instances of SKE as defined by a [Kratix Custom Resource](#the-kratix-crd).

## Features

While SKE is able to be installed directly [via manifests](./installation/via-manifest),
we highly recommend that you use the operator. Using the operator will reduce your work to
maintain SKE and all future operational features will only be available via the operator.

In specific the operator will:

* Validate SKE is in a healthy state before upgrading
* Roll out an upgrade to the next minor version
* Validate SKE upgrades work with current Promises by:
  * Re-running Promise workflows
  * Re-running resource workflows
* Provide information about the state of the upgrade once complete
* Enable pausing of platform requests during an upgrade

## The Kratix Custom Resource Definition (CRD)

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.syntasso.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kratix
metadata:
  name: my-kratix
spec:
  version: vX.Y.Z # The desired version of SKE, can be set to latest
```
