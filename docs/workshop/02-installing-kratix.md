## What is Kratix? {#what-is-kratix}


Kratix is a framework used by platform teams to build the custom platforms tailored to their organisation.

### Using Kratix to build your platform you can:

* use GitOps workflow with Flux and familiar Kubernetes-native constructs.
* co-create capabilities by providing a clear contract between application and platform teams through the definition and creation of ‚ÄúPromises‚Äù. We'll talk more about Kratix Promises in [the next step](installing-a-promise).
* create a flexible platform with your paved paths as Promises.
* evolve your platform easily as your business needs change.
* start small on a laptop and expand to multi-team, multi-cluster, multi-region, and multi-cloud with a consistent API everywhere.

### Providing a Kratix-built platform allows your users to:
- discover available services that are already fit-for-purpose.
- consume services on demand using standard Kubernetes APIs.
- move focus away from infrastructure toward adding product value.

## Hands on: Installing Kratix
Before you begin installing Kratix:

### System setup {#pre-requisites}

For this workshop, we'll use Kratix on two local Kubernetes clusters. Install the prerequisites listed below if they aren't already on your system.

1. `kind` CLI / **Kubernetes-in-Docker(KinD)**: <br />
  Used to create and manage local Kubernetes clusters in Docker. <br />
  See [the quick start guide](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) to install.

1. `docker` CLI / **Docker**: <br />
  Used to orchestrate containers. `kind` (above) requires that you have Docker installed and configured. <br />
  See [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install.

  :::caution

  Docker Desktop (For Mac) v4.13.0 has a [known issue](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6530) that crashes Docker Daemon on specific situations. Please ensure you are using an earlier or later version of Docker.

  :::

1. `kubectl` / **Kubernetes command-line tool**: <br />
The CLI for Kubernetes&mdash;allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters.<br />
See [the install guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).

#### Update your Docker resource allocations {#docker-config}
In order to complete all tutorials in this series, you must allocate enough resources to Docker. Docker requires:
* 5 CPU
* 12GB Memory
* 4GB swap

This can be managed through your tool of choice (e.g. Docker Desktop, Rancher, etc).

#### Delete existing Kratix KinD clusters {#delete-clusters}

Ensure no clusters are currently running.

```bash
kind get clusters
```

The above command will give an output similar to
```console
No kind clusters found.
```

If you have clusters named `platform` or `worker` please delete them with
```bash
kind delete clusters platform worker
```

#### Clone Kratix {#clone-kratix}

You will need the Kratix source code to complete this workhshop. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syntasso/kratix.git
cd kratix
```

### Installation {#install-kratix}

Now that your system is set up for the workshop, you can install Kratix! You should be in the `kratix` folder.

**Steps:**
1. [Set up your `platform` cluster](#platform-setup)
1. [Adjust networking for KinD](#kind-networking), if required
1. [Set up your `worker` cluster](#worker-setup)
<br /><br />

A complete installation of Kratix looks like the diagram below:

![Overview](/img/docs/Treasure_Trove-Install_Kratix.jpeg)

<br /><br />

| Reference | Component | Description |
| :---: | :--- | ----------- |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | `platform`&nbsp;&nbsp;cluster | The first of two local Kubernetes clusters that Kratix will use. This allows your platform to have orchestration logic separated from application workloads.  |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | Kratix CRDs  | A set of CRDs that Kratix requires. |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | `kratix`&#x2011;`platform`&#x2011;`controller`&nbsp;&nbsp;Pod  | At a _very_ high level, this manages the lifecycle of Kratix resources.  |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | An installation of [MinIO](https://min.io/) | [MinIO](https://min.io/) is a local document store, which is what the Kratix `platform` cluster needs for storing generated resource definitions. MinIO works well with KinD, but Kratix can use any storage mechanism that speaks either S3 or Git.  |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ | `worker` cluster | The second of two local Kubernetes clusters that Kratix will use. In this workshop, you run one single separate cluster to manage application workloads, but Kratix allows you to design the cluster architecture that makes sense in your context. |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£ | An installation of [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) | Kratix uses GitOps workflow, and [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) is the mechanism to continuously synchronise the resources defined in the document store (MinIO) to the `worker` clusters. Similar to document storage, this workshop uses Flux, but Kratix can use any tool that follows the GitOps pattern of using repositories as the source of truth for defining desired Kubernetes state.  |

<br />
Now that you know what the installation looks like, bring Kratix to life.
<br />

#### Set up your Kratix `platform` cluster {#platform-setup}

Create your `platform` cluster and install Kratix and MinIO.
```bash
kind create cluster --name platform --image kindest/node:v1.24.0 --config hack/platform/kind-platform-config.yaml
kubectl apply --filename distribution/kratix.yaml
kubectl apply --filename hack/platform/minio-install.yaml
```
<br />

As we create clusters, some `kubectl` commands will target the Platform cluster,
while others will target the Worker cluster. To simplify, make sure to set the
following environment variables

```bash
export PLATFORM="kind-platform"
export WORKER="kind-worker"
```

Verify that the Kratix API is now available.
```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get crds
```

You should see something similar to
```console
NAME                                   CREATED AT
bucketstatestores.platform.kratix.io   2022-05-10T12:00:00Z
clusters.platform.kratix.io            2022-05-10T12:00:00Z
gitstatestores.platform.kratix.io      2022-05-10T12:00:00Z

works.platform.kratix.io               2022-05-10T12:00:00Z
```
<br />

<p>Verify Kratix and MinIO are installed and healthy.<br />
<sub>(This may take a few minutes so <code>--watch</code> will watch the command. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop watching)</sub>
</p>

```bash
kubectl --context $PLATFORM get pods --namespace kratix-platform-system --watch
```

You should see something similar to
```console
NAME                                                  READY   STATUS       RESTARTS   AGE
kratix-platform-controller-manager-769855f9bb-8srtj   2/2     Running      0          1h
minio-6f75d9fbcf-5cn7w                                1/1     Running      0          1h
```
<br />

#### Adjust multi-cluster networking for KinD {#kind-networking}

Some KinD installations use non-standard networking. To ensure cross-cluster communication you need to run this script:

```bash
PLATFORM_CLUSTER_IP=`docker inspect platform-control-plane | grep '"IPAddress": "172' | awk '{print $2}' | awk -F '"' '{print $2}'`
sed -i'' -e "s/172.18.0.2/$PLATFORM_CLUSTER_IP/g" hack/worker/gitops-tk-resources.yaml
```

:::note
Running the above command will not change your local configuration, but rather update Kratix-provided configuration to use the appropriate KinD network.
:::

<br />

#### Set up your Kratix `worker` cluster {#worker-setup}

Create your Kratix `worker` cluster and install [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/). This will create a cluster for running the X as-a-Service workloads:

```bash
kind create cluster --name worker --image kindest/node:v1.24.0 --config hack/worker/kind-worker-config.yaml

# Register MinIO as a BucketStateStore
kubectl apply \
    --filename config/samples/platform_v1alpha1_bucketstatestore.yaml \
    --context $PLATFORM

# Register the Worker Cluster with the Platform Cluster
kubectl apply \
    --filename config/samples/platform_v1alpha1_worker_cluster.yaml \
    --context $PLATFORM

# Install Flux on the Worker Cluster
kubectl apply \
    --filename hack/worker/gitops-tk-install.yaml \
    --context $WORKER

# Configure Flux on the worker to pull down from MinIO
kubectl apply \
    --filename hack/worker/gitops-tk-resources.yaml \
    --context $WORKER
```
<br />

<p>Verify Flux is installed and configured (i.e., Flux knows where in MinIO to look for resources to install).<br />
<sub>(This may take a few minutes so <code>--watch</code> will watch the command. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop watching)</sub>
</p>

```bash
kubectl get buckets.source.toolkit.fluxcd.io \
    --context $WORKER \
    --namespace flux-system \
    --watch
```

You should see something similar to
```console
NAME                        URL   READY   STATUS                                                       AGE
kratix-workload-crds              True    stored artifact for revision: 9343bf26ec16db995d7b53ff63c64b7dfb9789c4   1m
kratix-workload-resources         True    stored artifact for revision: f2d918e21d4c5cc65791d121f4a3375ad80a3eac   1m
```
<br />

Once Flux is running, the Kratix running on the `platform` cluster will have the ability to manage resources on the `worker` cluster.

<p>Verify that you can deploy resources to the <code>worker</code> cluster&mdash;Kratix will always create a `kratix-worker-cluster` namespace, so you can check the namespace to ensure the installation has been successful.<br />
<sub>(This may take a few minutes so <code>--watch</code> will watch the command. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop watching)</sub>
</p>

```bash
kubectl --context $WORKER get namespaces --watch
```

You should see something similar to
```console
NAME                   STATUS   AGE
#highlight-next-line
kratix-worker-system   Active   1m
default                Active   3m32s
#highlight-next-line
flux-system            Active   3m23s
kube-node-lease        Active   3m33s
kube-public            Active   3m33s
kube-system            Active   3m33s
...
```

## Summary
You created a platform using Kratix. Well done!

To recap the steps we took:
1. ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;Setup your machine to run multiple Kubernetes clusters via KinD
1. ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;Installed Kratix on the `platform` cluster
1. ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;Installed MinIO on the `platform` cluster as the document store for our GitOps solution
1. ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;Confirmed that local networking allows those clusters to communicate
1. ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;Registered the `worker` cluster with Kratix
1. ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;Installed Flux on the `worker` cluster to continuously synchronise documents in MinIO to the `worker` cluster

Next you will install your first Kratix Promise.


## üéâ &nbsp; Congratulations!
‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;Kratix is now installed. <br />
üëâüèæ&nbsp;&nbsp; Next you will [install an sample Kratix Promise](installing-a-promise).
