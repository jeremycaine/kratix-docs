# Introducing Kratix üéâ

## Welcome!

<img align="right" src={useBaseUrl('/img/logo_300_with-padding.png')} />

This workshop introduces you to the [Kratix](https://www.kratix.io) framework.
We have created a series of tutorials that build up your understanding of what
Kratix is, how Kratix works, and how you can use Kratix to deliver a first-class
platform within your organisation.

Before beginning this workshop, consider your answers to the following questions:

* What is the highest value service your platform provides to your application development teams?
* How easy is it for you to provide and maintain that service?
* How easy is it for application developers to use that service?
* How can you enhance flow for your application developers and reduce effort for you and your platform team?

## The series

This workshop is divided into two parts. On Part I, the focus is on operating
Kratix. On Part II, we will dive into writing and extending Promises.
